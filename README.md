# PHSX815_Project3
The repository for the project 3 for PHSX 815

## Repository Orientation
There are four files (or will be in the final project). They are the `Code` file, the `LaTeX` file, the `Creations` file, and the `Writeup` file. the `Code` file contains the python code used for this project. The `LaTeX` file contains the `.tex` and `.bib` files for the project writeup. The `Creations` file contain the simulated data files and the figures used for the writeup. the `Writeup` file contains the `.pdf` writeup for project 3.

### Writeup
This one is pretty self explanitory. Review to make sure that this proposed project could work within the constraints of project 3 would be helpful.
